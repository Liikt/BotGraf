Bismarck:
- 12 o'clock midnight. I'm a little tired.
- 1 A.M. Admiral, is it not about time for bed?
- 2 A.M. *ya~wn*... Of course, I'm tired also...
- 3 A.M. You will rise properly tomorrow, yes? Could you please be punctual in the
  morning?
- 4 A.M. I shall take a short nap. All-nighters are bad for the skin.
- It's 5 A.M. Alrighty, get up! Good morning!
- 6 A.M. Well now, Admiral, let's go and get all the morning affairs in order!
- 7 A.M. Admiral, it is time for breakfast. What have you prepared for me?
- 8 A.M. This Admiral-made breakfast is pretty good. Japanese-style isn't bad.
- 9 A.M. Well now, let us up and go and start today's commerce raiding! ...Eh, I'm
  mistaken?
- 10 A.M. Kongou? Nagato? No, I don't know them. Who are they? Are they strong?
- It's 11 A.M... Yamato-class? That's got a strong feeling to it. I'd like to meet
  them.
- I am informing you that is it now 12 midday. Well now, what would be good for lunch?
- 1 P.M. Oh, those destroyers of a familiar ship class are here. I know those kids.
- 2 P.M. I wonder if Scharnhorst has also come here. I still would like to meet her.
- It's 3 P.M. I'd like to eat a little something sweet. Hey Admiral, did you hear
  me?
- 4 P.M. Almost evening, no? Shall we leave it at this?
- 5 P.M. Phew~, today was hard work as well. Well now, shall we stop at this checkpoint
  for today?
- 6 P.M. Almost time for dinner. Admiral, what kind of menu do you have for me?
- It is 7 P.M. The Admiral's sauerkraut has an odd flavor... Oh, this is 'tsukemono',
  you say?
- 8 P.M. It's really night now... It's bad for my skin, so could we not go on a night
  battle?
- 9 P.M. H~mm, Japanese battleships have such tall bridges. Those sisters sure are
  something.
- It's 10 P.M. I shall take a rest soon.
- 11 P.M. Admiral, are you still going? Good night.
Commandant Teste:
- It is now midnight. Today I will be in charge of practical work.
- It is now 1AM. This really is the time when someone should hit the bed.

  for you.
- It is now 3AM. Yes. I will stay awake, so you go ahead and sleep. Good night.
- It is now 4AM. It's going to be morning. I don't particularly mind the moment before
  sunrise.

- Right! It is now 6AM. To all fleet, please wake up! It's morning. Good day.
- It is now 7AM. I made you a baked croissant and coffee. Or maybe you'd prefer a
  wine. Bon Appetit!
- Very well, Let's begin our morning fleet activity. Would you like to start with
  fleet expeditions or fleet training?
- It is now 9AM. Admiral, would you like to drink some wine. Or would that be in the
  way of your work?
- It is now 10AM. Admiral, Here is your wine. I've prepared red for you. Bon appetit.
- It is now 11AM. What is your plan for lunch, would you like me to prepare one?

Graf Zeppelin:
- Guten Abend. Admiral, I'll be the secretary ship for today. Leave it to me... alright.
- 0100. Is this good? Leave it to me, there probably won't be a problem.
- 0200. Hm, perfect. Admiral. Admiral? Do you need me to do anything? I'll do my best
  as the secretary ship.
- 0300. I see, you'd like some coffee? Leave it to me. I'll make the best tasting
  coffee. I have plenty of confidence in the taste and smell off my coffee.
- 0400. How's that. This is real German coffee. Ah, first take a deep breath of the
  fragrance before drinking. After that... ah, nevermind. Drink up.
- 0500. It's already morning Admiral. How about you go have a shower? I'll continue
  supporting your official duties.
- Guten Morgen. 0600. Admiral, what do you want for breakfast? If you're satisfied
  with a simple breakfast, I can prepare it.
- 0700. Admiral. Kaiser rolls, cheese and ham and hot coffee. I'll leave it here.
  When you're free please eat it.
- 0800. Well, time to get to work. Let's start today's fleet operations. What should
  I do? What about some exercises with.... Akagi?
- 0900. Akagi, Kaga. Those two are the First Carrier Division of this country... huh.
  They don't have catapults or main guns.
- 1000. There are aircraft similar to my Messerschmitts. Are they not carrier-based
  planes as well? Then they're part of the Air Force.... What? That's wrong?
- 1100. It's almost lunchtime. Admiral? What do you want for lunch? What... Mamiya's
  you say? I've heard some rumours. Hmmm.
- 1200. Huh. So this is Mamiya's. There are... lots of things on the menu. Admiral,
  what do you recommend? Curry huh. Right, I'll have that.
- 1300. The curry for lunch... was pretty impressive cooking. So the fleet here always
  eats that huh. I see... fufu
- 1400. Ah, Bismarck. You're here too. I haven't been here long yet. Please teach
  me lots. Ah... is that... alright.
- 1500. The culture of this country is quite unique. Admiral, I'll try my best to
  study up whenever I can. Just like that U-boat.
- 1600. That is, Shoukaku and Zuikaku huh. They look intense. So they are the pinnacle
  of this country's aircraft carriers. Hmph.
- 1700. The day is ending. The sunset is beautiful no matter where you are. Admiral?
  What is it? Is there something wrong... with my face.
- 1800. Today's dinner... Ah, I was invited to a 'Fleet Carrier Party'... Admiral,
  would you like to go with me? Ah, yea.
- 1900. Ah, Akagi. Thanks for inviting me to the dinner party. Danke. What is... that?
  Nabe... you say? A strange cuisine.
- 2000. Nabe... is a bit like Pot-Au-Feu. Why do all of you surround the nabe? Taihou,
  teach me. How I am supposed to eat.
- 2100. That was a strange dinner party. But... yep, it was fun. Admiral. This fleet,
  and this base, is a good place.
- 2200. Admiral, it's quite late now. Come on, let's finish up today's work. Shall
  I brew some coffee?
- 2300. Admiral today was really tiring. Let's work hard tomorrow. Gute Nacht.
Haruna:
- 0000 hours. Admiral, thank you for your hard work with late night missions.

- 0300 hours. Admiral, Haruna will... stand guard... so you can go to sleep first...
- 0400... hours. Admiral... Haruna also wants to rest with you... but then the base
  defenses...

  will also do her best!

- 0900 hours! Admiral, the sortie preparations are ready!
- 1000 hours. Please leave today's operation schedule to Haruna!
- 1100 hours. Admiral, this is Haruna's plan for the day. How about taking a short
  rest?
- 1200 hours. You should take a break, Admiral, you're too busy. Please, for Haruna.
- 1300 hours. Admiral, leisurely having lunch with Haruna like this... is also an
  important duty...
- 1400 hours. The kanmusus' morale is rising! Let's all launch at once!
- 1500 hours. Admiral, the rankings have been updated. How about checking them with
  Haruna?
- 1600 hours. Admiral, update the fleet command's comments with Haruna as well!
- 1700 hours. Haruna is interested in the comments of the admirals around My Rank.
- 1800 hours. Admiral, it's getting late. It will be night soon.
- 1900 hours. The night view from the Admiral's office... Haruna loves this.
- 2000 hours. The hardworking cranes at the dock... Haruna thinks it's kind of romantic.
- 2100 hours. Haruna will also work hard like the cranes so that she can support the
  Admiral and the fleet!
- 2200 hours. Haruna said a bit too much tonight. Please forgive me.
- 2300 hours. Admiral, you should go to bed early sometimes.  Please, for Haruna.

- 7 A.M. Hmmm... I didn't get enough sleep, you know~  Off I go! With all my spirit!

  hear your impressions!
- It's 21 o'clock. It's been an hour since the Commander ran away... Why do you run
  from Hiei?!
- It's now 22 o'clock. *gloom* Looks like the Commander got away...
- 23 o'clock. Oh well, I guess I'll go to Onee-sama's room... Onee-... Commander!

- 0900. Commander? Commander!  Please wake uuuup! Kirishima is worried!
- 1000. Up until now, the time announcements have been a bit of trouble.  I unknowingly
  let it get to such a state!
- 1100.  All shipgirls, don't make such a ruckus.  Today's missions shall be performed
  in the afternoon!
- 1200.  Lunchtime, huh... Leave the commander's break to me, Kirishima.

- 1400.  The Commander has awakened.  Please leave the support to me, Kirishima.
- 1500.  The 2nd, 3rd and 4th fleets, are all off on expeditions!
- 1600.  There aren't any deficiencies in the docks and the construction decks? Check.
- 1700.  Commander, the weeklies are also coming along.  Just as expected!
- 1800... That girl, has weak electrical systems?  Wouldn't it be good to give them
  a hard whack?
- 1900. Oh, sorry. Kirishima typically likes to consider the theoretical possibilities.
- 2000. As the Commander's support, Kirishima is perfectly ready anytime!
- 2100.  Commander, erm... the critical part... I wasn't talking about my hairstyle!
- 2200.  Commander!  If you take my glasses, I can't fight!

  of them.
